# textpic
A program to make a picture out of text symbols. 

Console mode at the moment. Soon to be implemented as a program running in a window. 

The function "shades" renders the picture in several shades. It is better for rendering large pictures. The function "blocks" has only two shades: black and white. It is better for high contrast pictures and for rendering smaller amount of symbols. An example of the difference for a small amount of symbols (shades- top, blocks- bottom; 50x7 symbols):

An another example demonstrating the difference for a larger picture (shades- left, blocks- right; 300x129 symbols):
